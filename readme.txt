Replaces the video embed with a facade and fetches additional image sizes which are more responsive.

== Description ==

This plugin replaces the video embed with a facade and fetches additional image sizes which are more responsive. This all helps with the initial loading time of pages using the `core/embed`. It also replaces the default youtube URL with a no-cookie alternative.
